Inserts furigana for kanji words (Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome extensions)

This is a specific fork just from [origin project on Google
Code](https://code.google.com/p/furigana-injector) and before the first commit, the whold project here is
totally the same as the original one.

It is under the GPL2 

I forked it aiming at deploy it for personal use and after some fixes on codes, I make it just works. So after
the first commit, all the modifications are conducted by myself on a Mac and all of which are for a
Mac OSX platform.

I wish this project could be continued so I forked it. If having time, I will port the server side into Python
version so that deployment by non-programming-experience could be much easier.

In the future, an independent plugin without any backend is my pursuit. But it should take time. Anyone's
join is highly appreciated.
